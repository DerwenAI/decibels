There are ~11,700 SoundChecks of NYC Restaurants in this file
organized as follows:

For Column:

A: Venue ID (developer insisted on making the venue names anonymous,
but we can retrieve a specific venue name should you wish; same venue
ID means more than one soundcheck was taken for such venue - makes for
more robust data)

B: Restaurant Type (could be interesting segmented data analysis)

F: Zip code - could be good for seeing sound levels by Manhattan
neighborhoods

I/J/K: The Avg, Min, Max sound levels (AVG is what most people care
about, but those with Hyperacusis - sensitivity to loud or sudden
bursts of noise - care about Max)

L: Day of the week - could be some interested day of the week trends
for sound levels (are places louder during weekend days)?

M: Timestamp - sound levels by time of day could also be useful.


Hope you enjoy using this dataset!
